Answer to Question:
In my implementation there is already a button for delete, so it might not be a good idea to add 
another button for edit. My idea is the have all of the items editable and a click on the text 
allows the user to just edit the text. I believe that most of the users that would want to edit
the text would first click on the text it self and once the keyboard appears along with the text
cursor, they will understand that they can edit it.
In order to implement it i should allow editing existing items in TodoItemHolder, and then on click
a viewHolder allow to edit it.
